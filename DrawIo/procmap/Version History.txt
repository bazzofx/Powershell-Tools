v6.0


v5.9-------------------------------------------------------
Added new switch that will let use the -v or -verbose
By default each cell on mindMap will have the last binary of the path
-v or -verbose: Is used, the cell on the mindMap will have the full path of the file.
This will create a bigger mind map but will show the full path at a glance.

v5.8-------------------------------------------------------
Added new switch -nouser
-n or nouser : will skip the check if the row as an 'objectUser' header associated with it, this is useful for some reports.
Default : script will skip records that do not have an user associated with it.
For some reports which there is not a user associated with the line, we want to use this switch.
v5.7-------------------------------------------------------
If the report does not have an ObjectUser column or is blank we need to comment the line where it check if the colulmn exist 
inside the generateTemp1 function
