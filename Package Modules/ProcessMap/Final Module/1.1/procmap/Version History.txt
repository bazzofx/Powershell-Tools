Added new switch that will let use the -v or -verbose
By default each cell on mindMap will have the last binary of the path
-v or -verbose: Is used, the cell on the mindMap will have the full path of the file.
This will create a bigger mind map but will show the full path at a glance.

v5.8-------------------------------------------------------03/10/2023
Added new switch -nouser
-n or nouser : will skip the check if the row as an 'objectUser' header associated with it, this is useful for some reports.

For some reports which there is not a user associated with the line, we want to use this switch.
